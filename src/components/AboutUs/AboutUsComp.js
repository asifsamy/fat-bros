          We agree, it is not the most appetizing name for a product, but we
          have grown to love the name and we hope that you will too! Please
          allow me to tell a little story on how the name Dirt Dog was coined.
          In the early 90's I found myself on streets of Downtown Los Angeles
          most weekends and in the summer. My parents owned a business in
          Downtown Los Angeles and I found myself in Downtown with little
          choices for food. One super hot summer day in front of my parent's
          store, there was a nice Hispanic lady selling hot dogs on a flat
          grill. I had never seen this before. The hot dog was wrapped in bacon
          and toppings of grilled onions, bell peppers, red peppers and
          jalapenos were offered with mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup to sauce
          it up.
